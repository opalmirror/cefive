#summary Cheat Engine of Five

= Introduction =

Cheat Engine of Five is a complete rewrite, in stages, of NitePR Revision J.  Currently the binary is only usable for testing, and must be installed in *ms0:/seplugins*.  The Cheat Engine currently uses !NitePr cheat files from *ms0:/seplugins/nitePr*.  No changes have been made to the format of the cheat file.  Not all features have been reimplemented.  This program is not currently expected to work.  You were warned.
