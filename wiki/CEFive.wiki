#summary Cheat Engine of Five

= Introduction =

Cheat Engine of Five is a complete rewrite, in stages, of NitePR Revision J.  Currently the binary is only usable for testing, and must be installed in ms0:/seplugins.  The Cheat Engine currently uses NitePr cheat files from ms0:/seplugins/nitePr.  No changes have been made to the format of the cheat file.  Not all features have been reimplemented.  This program is not currently expected to work.  You were warned.
