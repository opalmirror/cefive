#summary The Cheat Panel

= Cheat Panel =

The Cheat Panel is the first screen that you encounter when you activate CEFive.  The Panel shows a list of cheats that you currently have loaded for the game that you are currently running.

== Operation ==
=== Navigation ===
The Cheat Panel List can be navigated up and down by using the *D-Pad*.  If more cheats have been loaded than could be displayed on the screen, the screen will scroll when the cursor has reached the top or bottom of the list.  Return to the game by pressing the *Circle Button*.  Pop up an applet menu with the *Left Trigger Button*.
=== Selection ===
Cheats can be selected by placing the cursor over the cheat that you wish to activate and then pressing either the *Cross Button* to select the cheat as _triggered_ or the *Square Button* to select the cheat as _constant_.  A _triggered_ cheat is toggled on and off with the music button in-game.  A _constant_ cheat is activated once by turning on the music key and then ignores the music key after it is activated.
== Editing a Cheat ==
Cheats can be edited by placing the cursor over the cheat that you wish to edit and pressing the *Triangle Button*.  This will launch the Cheat Editor with the Cheat that you have selected.
