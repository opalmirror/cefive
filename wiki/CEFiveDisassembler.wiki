#summary MIPS32 Disassembler for Cheat Engine of Five

= Disassembler =
The Disassembler is a real-time MIPS32 instruction decoder and disassembler for Cheat Engine of Five.  The Disassembler views current memory as MIPS32 Assembly Language.

== Controls ==
The Disassembler uses the following controls.

=== D-Pad Up/Down ===
The D-Pad is used to select the previous or next line in the Disassembler.  While the User is editing an Address or Value, the D-pad is used to increment or decrement the selected digit.

=== D-Pad Left/Right ===
The D-pad is used to select the Address or Value column in the Disassembler.  On lines containing *branch* instructions or *jump* instructions, pressing right while in the Value column will cause the Disassembler to jump to the destination of the instruction.  After jumping, pressing Left in the Address column will cause the Disassembler to jump back to the last address.  There is a stack of 10 addresses kept as history.  While the User is editing and Address or Value, the D-pad is used to select the previous or next digit in the Address or Value.

=== Cross Button ===
The Cross Button is used to start editing the selected Address or Value.  While the user is editing, the Cross Button is used to commit the Address or Value being edited to memory.

=== Circle Button ===
The Circle Button is used to exit CEFive.  While the user is editing, the Circle Button is used to cancel the Address or Value being edited and return it to its original value.

=== Square Button ===
The Square Button can be used in conjunction with D-Pad Up and Down to act as a Page selector.  Holding the Square Button while pressing the D-Pad Up, will cause the Disassembler to scroll one page up.  The same applies for down.

=== Left Trigger Button ===
The Left Trigger Button is used to pop up an Applet Menu allowing the user to select a different applet to invoke.  While the User is editing, the Left Trigger Button has no effect.
