#The Hex Keypad allows editing of Hexadecimal values.

= Introduction =

The Hex Keypad is a pop up dialog that is used to edit addresses and values in Base-16 or Hexadecimal.


== Controls ==

=== D-Pad ===
The D-Pad is used to select different digits in the Hex Keypad.

=== Left / Right Trigger ===
The Left and Right Trigger are used to select the previous and next digit in the value.  Pressing the Right Trigger on the final digit will close the Hex Keypad and commit the value or address.

=== Circle Button ===
The Circle Button is used to close the Hex Keypad and discard any changes made to the value.

=== Cross Button ===
The Cross Button is used to activate the currently selected digit in the value.  When a digit is highlighted, and the Cross button is pressed, the selected digit replaces the indicated digit in the value.  The cursor then moves to the next digit.  If the Cross button is pressed on the final digit, the Hex Keypad closes and commits the value or address.

=== Triangle Button ===
The Triangle Button is used to commit the current value and close the Hex Keypad.
